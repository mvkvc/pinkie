## Deployment

The recommended way to deploy the Pinkie server is using Docker. [Nixpacks](https://github.com/railwayapp/nixpacks) is used to build the production image with `shell/nixpacks.sh build` or you can pull the image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mvkvc/pinkie). The necessary configuration options are documented in the [configuration](https://docs.pinkie.sh/configuration) section of the documentation.

## Development

Make sure to have [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) installed before setting up your development environment. Next, navigate to the project root in a terminal and execute `nix develop --configure` to install all necessary dependencies and start a development shell. For subsequent sessions, you can directly enter the development shell by running `nix develop`. Alternatively, if you have `direnv` installed, after executing `direnv allow` once, the development shell will automatically start whenever you `cd` into the repository.
